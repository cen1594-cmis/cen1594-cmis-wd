			Green slime is always the easiest monster to kill in MMORPGs. Next on the scale of "fodder monsters" are yellow slime, followed by the red ones. Coincidentally, the yellow and the red slimes also rank pretty high on the list of "the devs were too lazy to make new monsters so they decided to reskin instead".
