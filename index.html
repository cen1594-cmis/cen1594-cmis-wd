					Lists and Links Assignment

				<p>
					In this assignment, we learned how to make and use the two different types of lists, ordered and unordered. We also learn how to use hyperlinks as well.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.
					</li>
					<li>
						Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"
					</li>
					<li>
						In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.
					</li>
					<li>
						Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to our main index page.
					</li>
					<li>

					</li>
